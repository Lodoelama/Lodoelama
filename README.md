## üöÄ About Me

Aspiring Cybersecurity Specialist and dedicated Paralegal with a passion for technology, I am eager to pursue a career in cybersecurity. I understand the importance of creating a strong foundation in this field, and I am actively working towards refining my skills through ongoing education and practical experience.

This project entails the design, development, and deployment of a secure web application hosted on Azure. It covers key aspects of cybersecurity, including IP networking, DNS, SSL/TLS certificates, cloud tenants, and the usage of Azure Key Vault for cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates management.

In addition to building technical skills, the project promotes a comprehensive understanding of cloud-based web application security, data protection, and secure web development practices.
