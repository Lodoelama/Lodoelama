In this Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, I navigated through a web application named 'Rekall,' leveraging my knowledge of various web application vulnerabilities to uncover 15 hidden flags. Each flag represented a unique security flaw, exposing weaknesses in areas such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Command Injection, Brute Force Attacks, PHP Injection, Session Management, and Directory Traversal.Through this exercise, I strengthened my skills in HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and networking concepts like HTTP
